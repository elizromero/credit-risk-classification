# Credit Risk Classification Project

## Using Logistic Regression Model

This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers based on historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending service. By analyzing the data, the model aims to classify loans as either 0 (healthy loan) or 1 (high-risk loan), providing valuable insights into loan risk.

Files in the project:

  - lending_data.csv: Dataset with historical lending information, including features like loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and more.
